# Unified Investment Visualization Platform

A lightweight, publicly hostable portfolio snapshot that lets individuals combine manual holdings, fetch live market prices from Alpha Vantage, and view aggregate value plus allocation weights across asset classes.

## What the static site does
- Add holdings by ticker, asset class, and share count.
- Pull live USD prices from Alpha Vantage (stocks, ETFs, some FX/crypto/commodities) with the free `demo` API key or your own key.
- Compute market value and allocation weight per holding automatically as you edit share counts or refresh quotes.
- Start from a sample set that includes USD/CNY cash, gold, silver, and major crypto and reset back to it anytime.

## Why Alpha Vantage
Alpha Vantage offers free real-time or delayed quotes for many global equities and FX pairs, including common metal/crypto symbols. The `demo` key lets you try the page immediately; adding your own key increases call limits. Quotes are fetched client-side—no backend or secrets required for publishing this page.

## Local site: manual portfolio capture
Run a lightweight static server to view the current site (no demo copy or placeholder data required):

1. From this repository root, start any static server (e.g., `python -m http.server 8000` or `npx serve .`).
2. Visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser to load the portfolio page with your latest changes.
3. Optionally paste your Alpha Vantage API key into the **Alpha Vantage API key** field (leave it blank to use `demo`).
4. Add a holding by entering the ticker (e.g., `AAPL`), selecting an asset class, and typing the number of shares/units. The page will fetch the live USD price via the Alpha Vantage `GLOBAL_QUOTE` endpoint and update value/weight.
5. Click **Refresh prices** to reload quotes for all holdings at any time.
6. Use **Reset to sample** to restore the starter portfolio.

### Live pricing tips
- The built-in `demo` key is highly rate-limited and only returns quotes for a handful of symbols; provide your own free key from [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key) for reliable results.
- If a lookup is blocked (rate limit, unsupported symbol, or bad key), the page shows an inline warning on the price cell and summarises the number of issues beneath the **Live pricing** heading.

## Hosting it publicly
This is a static site—no build step or server is required.
- **GitHub Pages:** Commit `index.html`, `style.css`, and `app.js` to a public repo → Settings → Pages → deploy from the default branch. Share the resulting `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>` URL.
- **Netlify/Vercel/Cloudflare Pages:** Drag-and-drop these files or point the host to the repo with a static-site preset (no build command needed).
- **Any static host:** Serve the three files from object storage or a CDN bucket.

## Files
- `index.html`: Structure of the portfolio page, including the live pricing controls.
- `style.css`: Gradient-driven styling, responsive form/table layout, and helper text.
- `app.js`: Client-side logic for holdings state, live price retrieval via Alpha Vantage, and aggregate calculations.

## Next steps (roadmap)
- Persist holdings and API key to local storage.
- Add currency conversion for non-USD base currencies.
- Expand broker connectors (IBKR, Trade Republic, and others) alongside the manual entry path.
- Layer in charts for allocation and performance over time.
